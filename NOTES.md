# Control Flow: Loops #

# Basic Loops in Ruby 
- while, 

# Looping with #times
- 
- Ruby blocks are just about as important a feature of the Ruby language as callbacks are in JavaScript (and they serve similar purposes). They're an incredibly powerful tool, and you'll see them used in many different scenarios, including writing loops.

# Looping with #each
- The #each method can be used with a few different data types, including arrays and objects (as we'll see later), but one common use case for the #each method is to use it with a Range:
    (1..20).each do |num|
        puts num
    end
-  Methods like #each help us write cleaner code that more clearly expresses our intent.
